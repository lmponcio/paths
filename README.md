# Relative Paths Explained

A static website to help people understand relative paths.

In the past, when onboarding new staff, I taught many times the concept of relative paths for using XREFs in AutoCAD. Later I learned that this simple concept is also used in websites and many other scenarios. That's why I decided to create a minimalistic example of how it works, to forward people here if someone needs help again in the future.
